# ankistatsonmenu

This app allows the display of user-specified anki deck remaining daily reviews to mac menu bar. It updates the remaining count every 30 seconds.

Note this is a mac only app and will not work on windows or other operating systems.

Download the zip file below, extract it, open the resulting folder and inside will be the .app file which you can double click to start the app.
Feel free to copy this .app file to your applications folder or drag it onto your mac's dock for easier access.

To make sure it is connected properly to your anki, ensure you have installed the anki connect plugin/addon within the anki app.

Note that when adding decks, the name of the deck must be an exact match. If you wish to add subdecks, you can press the gear icon next to the name deck on anki and it will show you the name you must use. It will include two colons "::" at each level of subdeck.

If you want to add multiple decks/subdecks in one go, you can do this by writing a semicolon ";" between each deck/subdeck name but make sure not to add spaces either side of the semicolon. The permisiveness of the deck/subdeck input/removal will be improved in a future version.
